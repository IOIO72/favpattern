# favPattern: Tamios Favorite UX Patterns

Sometimes I stumble upon ux patterns in apps, websites, consoles and other digital devices I really like. And in some
moments I get some ux pattern ideas, I start experimenting with.

Here I collect some self made adaptions and experiments of those ux patterns.

I copy some experiments to <http://codepen.io/IOIO72> and from time to time I write articles about them in my blog
<http://www.honma.de>.

# Setup

1. If you didn't before, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
1. If you didn't before, install [Gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/) `npm install --global gulp`
1. If you didn't before, install [Bower](http://bower.io/) `npm install -g bower`
1. Enter `git clone https://github.com/IOIO72/favPattern.git`
1. Enter `npm install`
1. Enter `bower install`

# Development workflow

## Serve and watch

```sh
gulp serve
```

This command builds the project, watches code changes and launches web browser and updates on code changes.

## Watch (default)

```sh
gulp watch
```

or

```sh
gulp
```

This is basically the same as the `serve` task, but without the web browser launching and updating.

## Build

```sh
gulp build
```

This task builds the project without watching and doing anything else afterwards.
